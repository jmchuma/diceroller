Apropos DiceRoller
============

This application is part of the Android Kotlin Fundamentals course.
What I have implemented differs a bit from the proposed app.

What does it do?

  * Displais two dices.
  * Rolls both dices at the same time but independently.
  * Resets the dices to the initial state.
  * Counts up from the dices' current state to 0.
  * Counts down from the dices' current state to 0.

What it doesn't do?

  * Lanscape mode.
  * Your laundry.
  * Your dishes.
